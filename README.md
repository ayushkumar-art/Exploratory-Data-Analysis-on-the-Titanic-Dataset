# 🚢 Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-the-Titanic-Dataset

This project explores the legendary **Titanic dataset** using Python and Power BI to uncover patterns in passenger survival. Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical insights, we aim to answer: _What factors most influenced survival chances on the Titanic?_

## 📁 Files Included

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `train.csv` | Training dataset with passenger details and survival status |
| `test.csv` | Test dataset for model evaluation (no survival info) |
| `gender_submission.csv` | Sample submission file for predictions |
| `Titanic_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with full EDA and insights |
| `Titanic_Dataset_Visualization.pbix` | Power BI file for interactive dashboards |

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess Titanic dataset
- Analyze features like age, class, gender, and fare
- Visualize patterns using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Power BI
- Identify key factors that impacted survival

---

## 📊 Technologies Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards
- **Kaggle Dataset**: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

---

## 📈 Key EDA Insights

- 💡 **Females had a higher survival rate** than males
- 💡 **1st Class passengers survived more** compared to 2nd and 3rd class
- 💡 **Children** (Age < 10) had better chances of survival
- 💡 High **fare-paying passengers** tended to survive more

---

## 🖼️ Sample Visualizations

- Survival count by gender and class
- Age distributions of survivors vs non-survivors
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Power BI dashboard with slicers and charts

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

The Titanic dataset reveals how **socio-economic status, gender, and age** played major roles in survival. This project combines the power of Python for analysis and Power BI for storytelling.
